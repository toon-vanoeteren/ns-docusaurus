# What about (Azure) standards?

:::important
A standard is a repeatable, harmonized, agreed and documented way of doing something. Standards contain technical specifications or other precise criteria designed to be used consistently as a rule, guideline, or definition.
:::

Using the knowledge that is contained in standards can save time and money during a product's research and development. You can also reduce the risk of ending up with a substandard or unsuccessful product. If we, our partners or suppliers and customers are all working to specified standards there will be fewer misunderstandings - saving time and money all around. Standardization offers several benefits, including:

1. **Consistency**: Standardization ensures that resources are deployed and configured consistently across the organization. This minimizes variations and reduces the risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities.

2. **Ease of Management**: With standardized templates and settings, resource management becomes more straightforward. Administrators can easily understand and manage resources across different projects or applications.

3. **Compliance and Governance**: Standardization ensures that all deployments adhere to regulatory requirements, security policies, and governance guidelines. This helps maintain a compliant and secure environment.

4. **Scalability**: Standardized templates and configurations allow for easy scalability, as resources can be provisioned and managed in a uniform manner, irrespective of the size of the deployment.

5. **Cost Optimization**: By using standardized configurations, organizations can identify cost-saving opportunities, allocate resources efficiently, and monitor spending effectively.

Overall, standardization is a **fundamental** aspect of effective Azure governance, enabling organizations to achieve operational efficiency, security, and consistency in their Azure deployments. It forms the basis for efficient resource management, enables better collaboration among teams, and supports long-term scalability and growth in the Azure cloud environment.
